Backing up your data is no longer a luxury, it is now a necessity.  A recent backup is your best defense against ransomware.

You should employ a 3-2-1 strategy for your backups.  Three copies on two different mediums with one copy ofsite.  If you have a local backou on a USB drive or a flash drive, that would account for two copies.  The last copy should be offsite.  Some offsite backup solutions include Carbonite, Crashplan, Mozy, Backblaze or SpiderOak.
